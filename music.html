						<h2>My Passion</h2>
						<span class="byline"> In 2010... </span>
						<p>
							I fell in love with electronic music. The first song I heard was Deadmau5's Strobe and from there I was hooked. I slowly began listening to the subgenres of trance, electro and trap. After about two years of listening, I needed something more. After attending my first music festival in 2012, I decided it was time to give DJing a shot. With addmittedly no standard musical tallent, responding "I play the iPod," when people asked if I had taken up an instrument, I was apprehensive. Before I knew it I was organizing and DJing my own events. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Once I got to college I joined the Tufts radio station, WMFO 91.5. For the past 2.5 years I have had a live one hour weekly mix show where I play a live mix of my favorite electronic songs at that time. Currently, I am the events coordinator at WMFO where I organize and execute events between the station, the university and the Medford/Somerville community. I have also recurited professional DJs and artists to play events for the community.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to my weekly show and my own events I am often hired to DJ private events.
